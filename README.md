# Jatrix Language by Outsider.NOC
An advanced programming language powered by AI models that  
**turns your messy text, wrong syntax, or even plain English into Python code.**  
Just type whatever nonsense you want, and Jatrix will  
**convert it into working Python code.**  
(NOTE: This project is still under developement)
---  

## 🌟 How It Works:  
- **Groq AI (Free but Limited):**  
  Uses the Groq AI model, which is functional but may have limitations.  

- **OpenAI (Paid but Powerful):**  
  For better performance, use your OpenAI API key.  

---  

## 🔑 Setup:  
1. **Choose Your AI Model:**  
   Open the Python file for either **Groq AI or OpenAI**.
If chosed OPEN AI, run this command in window powershell **pip install openai**
if chosed GROQ AI, run this command in window powershell **pip install groq**
2. **Insert Your API Key:**  
   Find the line `AI_api_key = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'`  
   (usually around lines 7 to 12) and paste your API key there.  

3. **Run the Python File:**  
   Execute it like any other Python file. (For Windows, double-click the `.py` file)

## ❗ Important Note:  
- The Groq AI model has limitations. If you face issues, it's likely due to these limitations.  
- The OpenAI model works better but requires a valid API key.
